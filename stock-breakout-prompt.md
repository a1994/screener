Strategy Logic Explained Simply
Think of this strategy as a "traffic light system" for entering and exiting trades. Here's how it works step-by-step:

The Core Idea
The strategy waits for multiple "green lights" to turn on at the same time before entering a trade. When any of those lights turn red, it exits.

LONG ENTRY (Going Bullish)
Step 1: Check MACD Momentum
text
Is the MACD line crossing ABOVE its signal line? 
→ This means momentum is shifting upward.
Step 2: Check Price Position vs Gann HiLo
text
Is the price ABOVE the Gann HiLo line?
→ This means the short-term trend is pointing UP.
Step 3: Check RSI Strength
text
Is the RSI value HIGHER than its moving average?
→ This means the momentum indicator itself is getting stronger.
Step 4: Check Supertrend Direction
text
Is the price ABOVE the Supertrend line?
→ This confirms we're in an uptrend (not a downtrend).
Step 5: Check Recent Price Action
text
Did price close HIGHER than the previous bar's high?
→ This shows momentum is actually happening right now.
IF ALL 5 GREEN LIGHTS ARE ON → ENTER LONG
LONG EXIT (Taking Profits or Cutting Losses)
The trade closes if ANY of these happen:

Exit Signal #1: MACD Turns Bearish
text
Does MACD cross BELOW its signal line?
→ Momentum is fading/reversing. Time to exit.
Exit Signal #2: Price Breaks Support
text
Does price drop BELOW the Gann HiLo line?
→ The uptrend support has broken. Exit now.
Exit Signal #3: Price Enters the "Confusion Zone"
text
Does price enter the Ichimoku cloud?
→ The cloud is a zone of uncertainty (neither clearly bullish nor bearish).
→ Better to exit and wait for clarity.
IF ANY 1 RED LIGHT TRIGGERS → EXIT LONG
SHORT ENTRY (Going Bearish)
Same logic, but reversed for downtrends:

Step 1: MACD Crosses Below
text
Is MACD crossing BELOW its signal line?
→ Momentum shifting downward.
Step 2: Price Below Gann HiLo
text
Is price BELOW the Gann HiLo line?
→ Trend is pointing DOWN.
Step 3: MACD Momentum Still Falling
text
Is MACD lower than the previous bar?
→ Downward momentum is accelerating.
Step 4: Price Below Gann HiLo Support
text
Is price BELOW the Gann HiLo?
→ Confirms downtrend bias.
Step 5: RSI Weakness
text
Is RSI LOWER than its moving average?
→ Momentum strength is weak/bearish.
Step 6: Supertrend Below
text
Is price BELOW the Supertrend?
→ Confirms downtrend.
Step 7: Recent Price Action
text
Did price close LOWER than the previous bar's low?
→ Recent action confirms downward momentum.
IF ALL CONDITIONS MET → ENTER SHORT
SHORT EXIT
Exit the short if:

MACD crosses back above signal line (momentum turns up)

Price breaks above Gann HiLo (support breaks upward)

Price enters Ichimoku cloud (uncertainty/ambiguity)

The Big Picture (Simplified)
Scenario	Action
Multiple bullish signals align (MACD up, price strong, RSI momentum on, trend confirmed)	BUY
Trade is running well but momentum fades (MACD crosses down)	SELL
Market becomes choppy (price in cloud)	EXIT and wait for clarity
Multiple bearish signals align (MACD down, price weak, RSI momentum off, trend reversed)	SHORT
Short running well but momentum reverses (MACD crosses up)	COVER
Why This Works
✅ Confluence-based: Doesn't rely on one indicator. Waits for multiple confirmations.

✅ Trend-following: Supertrend keeps you trading with the trend, not against it.

✅ Momentum-driven: MACD and RSI ensure you're entering when momentum is actually strong.

✅ Support/resistance aware: Gann HiLo acts as a dynamic level—exit if it breaks.

✅ Cloud filter: Avoids choppy, sideways markets where momentum is unclear.

Real-World Example
You see:

MACD crossing above signal line ✅

Price jumped above Gann HiLo ✅

RSI is higher than its moving average ✅

Price is above Supertrend ✅

Price closed above yesterday's high ✅

→ Enter a long position

Then you monitor:

If MACD crosses back down → Exit (momentum dead)

If price drops below Gann HiLo → Exit (trend broken)

If price moves into cloud → Exit (too choppy)

Otherwise, hold and let profits run.

This is essentially a "wait for multiple confirmations, then enter; exit on first sign of weakness" strategy—a solid approach for swing trading where you want to minimize false entries.
